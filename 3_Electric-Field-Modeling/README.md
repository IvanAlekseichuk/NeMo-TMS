# Electric Field Modeling.
In this step the aim is to calculate the electric fields generated by TMS at the macro- and mesoscopic scale. This includes computing the spatial distribution and time course of the TMS electric field. Since the stimulation frequency is relatively low, we can use the quasi-static approximation to separate the spatial and temporal components of the electric field.<sup>[a](#myfootnoteA)</sup>
