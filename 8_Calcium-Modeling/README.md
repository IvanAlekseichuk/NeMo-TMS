# Running Calcium Dynamics Simulations
Calcium simulations are run using the [uG4](https://github.com/UG4) simulation framework, in this guide we will explain how to run the simulations by 
running a VRL-ug4 gui simulator, see [VRL](https://vrl-studio.mihosoft.eu/) for downloading VRL studio. 
The VRL-ug4 gui will simulate the calcium dynamics inside a neuron, through activation by voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCC's), these channels follow the Borg-Graham model for calcium exchanges.

## VRL-uG4 GUI Simulation (MacOS Catalina Version 10.15.5 & Windows 10)
The following steps have been tested on MacOS and Windows 10, the Linux version is still in development.
To run a simulation using VRL:
1. please install [VRL](https://vrl-studio.mihosoft.eu/) studio, this is the gui used for setting file paths and simulation parameters. 
2. Then download <code>VRL-CalciumDynamics.zip</code> and extract the contents to the Desktop of your computer.
The folder <code>VRL-CalciumDynamics</code> that is extracted will have the following contents

![vrlfiles](images/vrlfiles.png)

Below is a description of the folders and files:
  - <code>geometry</code> is the folder that contains the <code>.swc</code> geometry file
  - <code>scripts</code> is the folder containing the <code>.lua</code> script for ug4 and an example shell script <code>testrun.sh</code> for advanced users who wish to run the script through the terminal shell.
  - <code>output</code> this folder will contain the output data once the simulation is finished running
  - <code>ug4</code> this is a static build of ug4, this is needed for the simulation to run
  - <code>iondynamics-01.vrlp</code> this is the VRL studio project used for running the <code>.lua</code> script into ug4. 
  - <code>voltageData</code> this is the voltage data that is used for the VDCC's, 

3. For a simulation to run you will need a geometry file in <code>.swc</code> format.
4. Next move your voltage data into <code>VRL-CalciumDynamics/voltageData</code> folder
4. Double click the file iondynamics_01.vrlp to open the workflow in VRL studio. You will see the window below

5. You will need to select the file locations for the uG4 folder, simulation script, Geometry <code>.swc</code> file, VM folder (voltage), and output folder. 
These are boxed in red in the figure above. Disregard the large code window. Set the other parameters to desired values, for now leave ER ON/OFF unchecked.
  - For the simulation script choose <code>vdccFullCellCalcium.lua</code> inside the 'scripts' folder.
  - For the Geometry choose the file with <code>.swc</code> extension, make sure the geometry corresponds to the voltage data (used the output of [previous step](../7_NEURON_UG4_Interface)).
6. Once you have selected the folders, files, and set the desired parameters, press the invoke button and the simulation will begin.
7. You can  monitor the progress of the simulation by clicking the bottom tab on the button and pulling the tab up.

8. Once the simulation is completed the output will contain the following files and folders:

Below is a description of the files:
  - <code>fullDataOut.txt</code> is a text file containing the voltage at every node through time. An entire row is the voltage at one node through every time step.
  - <code>outDom.txt</code>, <code>outDom.swc</code>, and <code>outDom.ugx</code> is the neuron geometry used given in different formats
  - <code>run-simulation.sh</code> is the bash shell script for running the code, for Windows 10 this is a PowerShell script and will have the <code>.ps1</code> extension.
  - <code>meas</code> is a folder containing the separate calcium concentrations for the different geometry subsets
  - <code>vtk</code> is a folder that contains the vtk output for the calcium concentrations and vtk output of the VDCC voltage data. Both files can be opened in Paraview.

## Software Requirements
* [VRL](https://vrl-studio.mihosoft.eu/) studio, this is the gui used for setting file paths and simulation parameters.
* [uG4](https://github.com/UG4) simulation framework
* **Optional:** [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/), [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/download/) both for visualization of output data
* **Optional:** [ProMesh](http://www.promesh3d.com/) for visualizing the 3d geometry and converting from <code>.swc</code> to <code>.ugx</code>
