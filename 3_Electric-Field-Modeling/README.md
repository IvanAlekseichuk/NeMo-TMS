# Electric Field Modeling.
In this step the aim is to calculate the electric fields generated by TMS at the macro- and mesoscopic scale. This includes computing the spatial distribution and time course of the TMS electric field. Since the stimulation frequency is relatively low, we can use the quasi-static approximation to separate the spatial and temporal components of the electric field.<sup>[a](#myfootnoteA)</sup> Here, we only focus on the spatial distribution of the electric field since the temporal component is calculated in a different [step](../5_TMS_Waveform/). Here, we use Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling to numerically calculate the distribution electric field in any sophisticated geometries. In this pipeline, we use the open-source software [SimNIBS](https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/) which is a versatile simulation platform that can simulate TMS electric fields for various geometries and a variety of TMS coils. For a quick start on how to use SimNIBS visit [here](https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/build/html/tutorial/gui.html) (you can skip the section describing setting up a tDCS Simulation). For more information refer to [SimNIBS tutorials](https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/build/html/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## FEM models
You can use prebuilt FEM models or generate your own models to use in SimNIBS. You can find human head models in the [SimNIBS example dataset](https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/build/html/dataset.html) and some animal and _in vitro_ models in the [translational FEM dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3857041#.XyMdYihKhPY). Alternatively you can generate your own FEM models as explained [here](https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/build/html/tutorial/head_meshing.html).
