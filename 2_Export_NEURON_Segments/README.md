# Export NEURON Segments
This script is automatically generated in the [first step](../1_NEURON-Model-Generation). The coordinates and other information about the segments implemented in the HOC model are exported from the generated NEURON model. These data are used in multiple subsequent steps.

## Instructions
Run <code>save_locations.hoc</code> in the NEURON model directory. The output data will be exported in the 'results\locs\' folder.

## Software Requirements
[NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) (Tested on NEURON 7.5)
