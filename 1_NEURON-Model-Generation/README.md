# Neuron Model Generation
This stage of the pipeline will generate NEURON HOC model files from .SWC morphology files, or TREES Toolbox generated .MTR files which contain multiple morphologies.

Currently, the pipeline supports the Jarsky model of the CA1 pyramidal cell. 

## Instructions
Before running any scripts utilizing TREES Toolbox, initialize TREES Toolbox by running the included start_trees.m. This only needs to be done once per computer.

Additionally, T2N must be initialized before use, with the script t2n_runthisAfterUnzip.m.

First, compile the mod files located in Generator/lib_mech/mods. This is a necessary step for each computer that the simulations are executed on. Refer to this [link](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=3263) for more information on how to do this. After this is done, move the nrnmech.dll file to Generator/lib_mech.

Next, place the input morphology file (either .SWC or .MTR if multiple morphologies are to be processed) into Generator/morphos alongside the place_tree.mtr file.

The input morphology must be in standard SWC format, with soma as region 1, axon as region 2, basal dendrites as region 3, and apical dendrite as region 4.

Open <code>Jarsky_model.m</code> in MATLAB and change the line labelled "Input file here" to refer to the selected input morphology. Run the script.

If the input morphology lacks an axon, uncomment line 46, and a simple "stick" axon will be added. If the input morphology lacks a soma, uncomment line 45, and a soma will be added at the intersection of the branches.

For each morphology given, a figure will be produced showing the assigned model regions.

Every time the generation is completed, the script will return an error: ![Error image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpitzLab/Multi-Scale-Neuron-Modeling/master/1_NEURON-Model-Generation/expected_error.png?token=AAIAFOUXC34VND3OCJN7DGS7FP7QI)

 - ignore this: It is expected. After completion, the script will copy all other necessary files to the model folders.
