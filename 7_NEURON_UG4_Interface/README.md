# NEURON-UG4 Interface
In this step we describe how the simulation results from NEURON can be converted into a format compatible with UG4 for calcium simulations. UG4 requires the following data to work:
* Voltage traces across the neuron segments at each time point
* The morphology file (SWC format) corresponding to the neuron segments (Note that this morphology file may be different from the original morphology file you used to generate NEURON models).

## Instructions
This directory and its contents are automaticlly placed in the root NEURON model folder when the NEURON model is generated in the [first step](../1_NEURON-Model-Generation/). This ensures the files are in the correct location to access the input data. Run <code>export_data()</code> in this directory in Matlab. The following files will be exported in this foler:
1. <code>neuron_out.swc</code> represents the morphology file 
2. Inside the 'voltage_data_calcium' folder, (<code>vm_#####.dat</code>) files contains the voltage data from the NEURON simulation. Each file includes the voltage data of all segments (and their coordinates) at one simulation time point.
